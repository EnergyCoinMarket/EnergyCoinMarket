Welcome to ECM, the first ecosystem that enables you to generate and use your own energy in an unprecedented way.
Addressing the challenges of the modern world, Energy Coin Market has created a distributed, zero-emission energy system based on renewable energy sources (OZE), 
hydrogen technologies, and advanced solutions such as blockchain and AI.
The fundamental components of ECM are clusters that produce green energy.
Through the process of digitization, the energy produced in these clusters will belong to you - the users.
The digital representation of generated energy applied by ECM opens up incredible new possibilities.
It allows you to purchase products, services, use energy anywhere, or exchange it for traditional means of payment.
The key principle in designing the ecosystem was the decentralization of energy sources, democratization of global energy, and the decarbonization of daily life. 
The goal is to change the perception of energy and its value.
By creating an advanced, ecologically-oriented, self-sufficient community, we aim to build a new future.
Energy Coin Market has developed products that will provide people with security and an easier 
life in the face of global climate change and continually rising energy prices.
